# Audio Processing and Wi-Fi Alert Transmission using ESP32 and FreeRTOS with Microphone Interface

This project aims to develop a safety-enhancing system that integrates embedded systems, audio processing, machine learning, and Wi-Fi communications. The system utilizes ESP-32 and FreeRTOS to enable real-time audio analysis and transmission of classified audio signals as alerts or notifications over a Wi-Fi network.

## Features

- Audio processing module for real-time analysis of audio signals
- Machine learning module using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify audio signals
- Wi-Fi communication module for transmitting classified audio signals as alerts or notifications
- Microphone interface for capturing audio input

## Prerequisites

- ESP-32 development board
- FreeRTOS library
- [Add any other dependencies or hardware requirements]

## Installation
